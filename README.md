# Codex Test Playground

This repository is created to explore and evaluate the capabilities of **OpenAI Codex** in real-world development workflows.  
You can use it to write, refactor, test, document, and automate tasks with the help of AI.

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal is to build a flexible playground where various **Codex features and behaviors** can be tested across different languages, frameworks, and use cases.

## 🚀 Features to Test

### 🔧 General Programming
- [x] Generate boilerplate code (e.g. CRUD, CLI tools, UI components)
- [ ] Refactor existing code for readability or performance
- [ ] Add inline documentation/comments
- [ ] Explain complex code snippets
- [ ] Translate code between languages (e.g. JS → Python)
- [ ] Suggest optimizations or improvements

### 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Generate unit tests (e.g. with JUnit, Jest, PyTest)
- [ ] Apply TDD/BDD practices
- [ ] Create mocks and test data
- [ ] Achieve edge-case coverage
- [ ] Auto-fix failing tests

### 📦 Project Setup & Configuration
- [ ] Scaffold new project structures (e.g. React app, Spring Boot API)
- [ ] Generate `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `Dockerfile`, etc.
- [ ] Write environment setup scripts (e.g. Bash, PowerShell)
- [ ] Setup CI/CD (e.g. GitHub Actions, Docker workflows)

### 🗂️ Code Documentation
- [ ] Generate `README.md` files
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Describe classes, methods, and modules
- [ ] Auto-generate changelogs

### 📁 Git & Version Control
